## Creating issues

Before making an issue, please take the time to look through already existing and closed issues on both the GitGud and GitHub repo, to prevent duplicate issues. If an issue becomes relevant again, feel free to make a post in the relevant issue thread and it'll be reopened.

Things that are helpful when writing an issue:

- Try to describe the problem as best as possible
- Is the issue consistently reproducible? If so, provide the steps to reproduce the issue
- If the problem is visual, try to record it or screenshot it
- Provide logs of `plasmashell`, `kwin_x11`, `kwin_wayland` etc. as the issue occurs. For more information regarding testing and logging, read [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md).
- Provide the following relevant specifications of your system:
    - Linux distribution, version and CPU architecture
    - Qt, KDE and KDE Frameworks versions
    - Display server (X11 and/or Wayland)
    - Monitor setup and monitor capabilities (Multimonitor, DPI, HDR, etc.)
    - GPU drivers
    
## Merge requests

Merge requests should only be done on the [GitGud](https://gitgud.io/wackyideas/aerothemeplasma) repo as the GitHub repository is only a mirror.
